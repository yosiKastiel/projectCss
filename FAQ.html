                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then

                        The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is
                        the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
                        streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers.
                        If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
                        to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                        Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
                        seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                        By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of
                        us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going
                        to every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even
                        large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys,
                        stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                        anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon
                        since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
                        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                        position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie,
                        which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before
                        Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                        The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally the Sunday
                        closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).

                        The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their
                        inner-city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the
                        corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu
                        passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade.

                        The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of
                        March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at
                        Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers
                        and
                        suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                        For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.

                        Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade on the
                        Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years,
                        there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open
                        weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details are available on
                        these
                        events at this time.

                        The date of Mardi Gras changes every year because it's connected to Easter, which can fall on
                        any Sunday between March 23 and April 25. Mardi Gras day always takes place 47 days before
                        .
