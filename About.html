        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
            are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent
            in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
            days have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras
            season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
            parades
            and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and
            route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
            Knights of
            Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
            events,
            such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their
            parades), the
            Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure
            Clubâ€”a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The
            most common
            throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and
            small
            inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown
            and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
            the
            French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown
            in the
            Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
            concludes
            with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

        <h1>History</h1>

        <p>
            The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
            what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
            celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
            festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and
            dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from
            1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
            streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever
            such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich
            plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.

            James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi
            Gras in 1835:

            Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic,
            and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and
            boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and
            appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with
            heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and
            bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and
            march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the
            streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast
            as they wend their reckless way.

            In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe
            Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of
            Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans
            had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that
            the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent,
            Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the
            Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them construct a
            more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American
            just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of
            Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and
            on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
            American."

            In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
            conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil
            War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

            In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
            surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came
            to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining
            order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating
            morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the
            city's best Mardi Gras ever.

            In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi
            Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
            sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed,
            the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing
            traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protestâ€”and because the city
            claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership listsâ€”the 19th-century krewes
            Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its
            parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

            Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal
            courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of
            free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The
            US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.

            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues,
            and any member can have a place on a parade floa
